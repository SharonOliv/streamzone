To get data from web
Axios is a JavaScript library that's used to make HTTP requests from a web browser or Node.js
For axios=> npm install axios

Using JSON server to create a fake API
=>An API is something that acts as a communicator between a server and client 
=>It simply handles sever client request and responses
=>Now we don't need a real API to test our website
=>APIs can manipulate,retrieve data from database upon receiving a htt/url request 
We are using JSON server library to create a fake server
create a file JsonServer.js in src for server 
create a file db.json in moviemax which is the database
for that install it => npm i json-server
use -g after i for installing this globally so where ever we run a command for it-> it works

For us to fetch the data properly 
run the server first => npx json-server --watch Data/db.json --port 3001
=> using use effect hook to fetch the data from user
